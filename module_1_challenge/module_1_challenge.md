# Betterment

## Overview and Origin

Name of the company is Betterment, and it was founded by Jon Stein in 2008. 
The founder, Jon Stein, had the idea to help people make rational decisions to make the world better. Throughout his consulting job, his idea has developed further. He wanted to give people the right guidance for their personal investment. He also wanted to make that guidance accessible to many people with the help of technologies.



## Business activities

Betterment started with the idea of helping people achieve their financial goals through savings and investments. They provide automated investment by using their own technology and human experts. 

Their main target audience are all the people who needs to reach their financial goals. In detail, Investopedia's survey revealed that the majority of their users are in their 30s and 40s; which makes sense since those age groups are commonly associated with big purchases.



## Landscape

Betterment is in the domain of robo-advisor and personal finance. 
Other major companies in this domain: SoFi Automated investing, Wealthfront, Vanguard personal advisor services
Emergence and integration of AI and machine learning has been great innovation for this domain over the last 5 - 10 years.
However, Betterment's portfolio construction uses technoques calls 'Monte Carlo simulations' and 'Black-Litterman model' instead of using machine learning or neural networks like other companies.

## Results

According to the Betterment website, they have $40+ billion of assets under management (AUM) as of Aug 30, 2023 and their reported customer count is 800,000+.

# Betterment

We are currently living in the time where it is very convenient to invest our money. One part reason how this became possible is with the emergence of the financial domain called 'robo advisory.' It is a digital platform that can provide financial services planning without the help of human experts through automation and algorithm based decision making process. Traditionally, investment consultation was only for the people who invests large amount of money who could afford the cost of consultation with the expert, but with the help of robo advisor, smart investing becaome widely accessible to wide range of people with much lower cost. One of the leading company that made this possible is Betterment.

## Overview and Origin

Betterment is a US robo advisor company, and it was founded by Jon Stein in 2008. 
The founder, Jon Stein, had the idea to help people make rational decisions to make the world better. Throughout his consulting job, his idea has developed further. He wanted to give people the right guidance for their personal investment. He also wanted to make that guidance accessible to many people with the help of technologies.
Betterment is funded by 27 investors with 10 rounds of fundings as of now. Some of the major investors are AB Kinnevik, Bessemer Venture Partners, Francisco Partners, and Menlo Ventures. Their most recent round of funding raised $160 million which was comprised of Series F equity of $60 million and $100 million credit facility. This raise has pushed the company's market value to about $1.3 billion. 



## Business activities

Betterment started with the idea of helping people achieve their financial goals through savings and investments. They provide automated investment by using their own technology and human experts. 

Their main target audience are all the people who needs to reach their financial goals. In detail, Investopedia's survey revealed that the majority of their users are in their 30s and 40s; which makes sense since those age groups are commonly associated with big purchases.
The company uses robo-advisory automation in order to perform their portfolio construction. Once their customers have answered their questionnaires, the automated system constructs portfolio for the customer without the intervention of human experts.
The company offers $0 account minimum and only $10 to start investing, which makes it easy and accessible to the investors who does not have a lot of money to invest at first. This lowers the entry barrier to small investors. Compared to its competitors, the company also offers automatic sweep functionality and offers acces to checking account and a high-yield cash reserve account through their partnered banks.
The company is also known for its great user experience compared to its competitors.
However, Betterment's portfolio construction uses technoques calls 'Monte Carlo simulations' and 'Black-Litterman model' instead of using machine learning or neural networks like other companies.


## Landscape

Betterment is in the domain of robo-advisor and personal finance. 
Other major companies in this domain: SoFi Automated investing, Wealthfront, Vanguard personal advisor services
Emergence and integration of AI and machine learning has been great innovation for this domain over the last 5 - 10 years.
In the past 10 years, the traditional financial institutions such as Black Rock and Vanguard also launched robo-advisor services.


## Results

According to the Betterment website, they have $40+ billion of assets under management (AUM) as of Aug 30, 2023 and their reported customer count is 800,000+.
Some core metrics to measure the company's success would be assets under management (AUM) and customer numbers. 
Advisory fee is another metric used to compare companies.
Performance level another indicator.
Based on the report from the Robo Report from Condor Capital, in the second quarter of 2022, Betterment ranked 8 out of 15 companies that the report compared against. In terms of performance alone, Betterment ranked 10 out of 15.



## Recommendations

I would suggest the company to build a chat bot that can function as their customer's financial advisor. The company has lowered the entry barrier to a lot of people which makes it easy for anyone to start investing their money, but they would also like to know where they are investing and they would also have specific areas where they want to invest in. Moreover, a lot of those people may not have much of financial knowledge to understand investing to begin with. 
In these cases, I think the chat bot would be able to address all these issues. By having conversation with their customers, the chat bot can recognize specific fields or areas where their customers want to invest into and it can re-construct the portfolio accordingly. Also, the chat bot could also explain to their customers why and how their portfolio is constructed, and it could also answer any questions that thier customers may have. By doing these, the company can provide more personalized portfolios and also have better customer satisfactions.
Large Language Model would be a good technology to apply in this case to launch the suggested service. LLM will be able to have very human-like conversation with their customers, and it would also be able to provide appropriate answers to the questions that their customers may be asking.
